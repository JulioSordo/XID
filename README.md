## What is XID?

XID (eXistence ID) is a groundbreaking global digital identity solution that evolves the concept of identity in the digital age. Built on the fast, secure, and scalable **XRP Ledger**, XID provides a single, sovereign, and inviolable identity accessible from anywhere in the world. It eliminates dependence on centralized institutions and offers a decentralized platform for managing all aspects of life.

> **Manifiesto**: In a world divided by borders and fragmented systems, XID is your story, your health, your education, your economy, your voice, and your freedom—programmed for sovereignty, not granted by others.
